    "text3": "Career has always experienced a high retention rate for both Officers and Ratings. Five of the ten cadets deployed in 1975, are still engaged within the Career family. Every year Career deploys at least 150 deck, engine and electrical cadets, mostly products of its In-House Cadet Training Program and IMEC Program with MAAP/UC. This is how our company strengthens and replenishes our future officers. In 2015, we deployed 96 Masters and 127 Chief Engineers to various types of ocean-going vessels."
